Implements a small library in C++ using expression templates and modern C++11/14/17 features like generic lambdas to:

1. represent a matrix of numerical types (int, long, float, double, complex,....)
2. compute algebraic expressions including elementwise addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication operations using the operators +, -, +=, -=, etc.
3. standard matrix multiplication using the most simple algorithm with an operator of your choice.
4. fit in one header file
5. provides a test program which measures the speed of execution for each examples provided
